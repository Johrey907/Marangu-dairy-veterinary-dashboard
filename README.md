# Power BI Dashboard: Veterinary Services Adoption Among Small-Scale Dairy Farmers in Marangu (2024)

The dashboard reveals strong adoption of essential animal health practices among small-scale dairy farmers, with artificial insemination utilized by about 79 percent and treatment services leading at roughly 80 percent, indicating widespread recognition of improved breeding and disease management for productivity enhancement. Vaccination uptake stands at nearly 66 percent, reflecting moderate preventive care but signaling the need for expanded outreach to strengthen herd resilience.

Gender-disaggregated insights show higher livestock ownership among women, underscoring their central role in dairy production. Village-level analysis identifies Mshiri and Ashira as having the largest average herd sizes, aligning with comparatively higher milk outputs. Aggregate production reached approximately 622,000 litters, with livestock valued at around 342 million, emphasizing the sector’s economic importance and the productivity gains associated with veterinary service utilization.

The dashboard demonstrates how business intelligence tools can enhance agricultural research by improving data interpretation, supporting policy discussion, and guiding interventions aimed at strengthening livestock management and rural livelihoods.
