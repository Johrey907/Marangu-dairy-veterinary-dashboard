# Marangu-dairy-veterinary-dashboard
This repository presents an interactive Microsoft Power BI dashboard developed to analyze veterinary service adoption among small-scale dairy cattle farmers in Marangu, Kilimanjaro Region. The dashboard was created as part of a Master of Science in Economics dissertation completed at Mzumbe University in 2024.

The visualization provides insights into key aspects of dairy farming, including artificial insemination use, vaccination and treatment adoption, gender distribution of livestock ownership, village-level herd sizes, and milk production performance. By transforming raw survey data into clear visual metrics, the dashboard supports data-driven evaluation of animal health practices and their relationship to productivity among smallholder farmers.

The project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can enhance agricultural research by improving data interpretation, supporting policy discussion, and guiding interventions aimed at strengthening livestock management and rural livelihoods.
